Deepfake Detection Model Overview
1. DatasetHandler Class

The DatasetHandler class is responsible for:

Dataset Management:

Automates downloading a zipped dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.

Handles potential download errors and extracts the dataset.

Confirms successful extraction.

Image Loading:

Uses tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory to:

Load images from the extracted dataset.

Automatically infer labels from directory structure (real/fake).

Resize images to 128x128 pixels.

Data Splitting and Shuffling:

Splits the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

Shuffles the dataset with a fixed seed for reproducibility.

Batches data with a batch size of 64.

2. DeepfakeDetectorModel Class

The DeepfakeDetectorModel class focuses on building and configuring the model:

CNN Architecture (Convolutional Neural Network):

Input layer: Accepts 128x128 RGB images.

Preprocessing:

Rescales pixel values to the range [-1, 1] using a rescaling layer.

Convolutional Layers:

Four convolutional layers with the following specifications:

Filters: 32, 64, 128, and 256.

Kernel Size: 3x3.

Stride: 1, Padding: 'same'.

Batch normalization layers for stability.

Max pooling layers (2x2) for downsampling and introducing translational invariance.

Fully Connected Network (FCN):

Flattened output from the convolutional layers is fed into two dense layers:

Dense Layer 1: 512 units, ReLU activation.

Dense Layer 2: 256 units, ReLU activation.

Dropout (0.5 rate) added after each dense layer to prevent overfitting.

Output Layer:

Dense layer with 128 units before the final output.

Output: A single unit with a sigmoid activation function to predict the probability of deepfake (0 to 1).

Model Compilation:

Optimizer: Adam with configurable learning rate.

Loss Function: Binary crossentropy (binary classification).

Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall.

3. TrainModel Class

The TrainModel class is the central orchestrator, managing the complete training pipeline:

Training Flow:

Dataset Handling:

Downloads, unzips, and loads the dataset via the DatasetHandler class.

Model Creation:

Instantiates the DeepfakeDetectorModel.

Model Compilation:

Compiles the model with a default learning rate of 0.0001.

Model Training:

Trains the model for a specified number of epochs (default: 10).

Model Evaluation and Saving:

Evaluates the trained model on the test set.

Saves the final trained model (architecture and weights).

4. Callbacks Used During Training

EarlyStopping: Stops training if validation loss does not improve.

ReduceLROnPlateau: Reduces the learning rate if validation performance stagnates.

ModelCheckpoint: Saves the model with the lowest validation loss.

5. Model Evaluation and Saving

Model Evaluation:

After training, the model is evaluated on the test set.

Saving the Model:

The final model (including architecture and weights) is saved for later use.

6. Training Progress Visualization

The notebook concludes by:

Printing evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

Plotting training history to visualize learning progress over epochs.
