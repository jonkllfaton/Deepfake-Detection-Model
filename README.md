# Deepfake-Detection-Model
Deepfake detection model built with TensorFlow/Keras. The project includes automated dataset handling, a CNN for image classification (real vs fake), and model training with callbacks (EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, ModelCheckpoint). Evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, and recall. Run with python train.py.
